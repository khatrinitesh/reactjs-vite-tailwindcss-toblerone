          How do we process Children’s Personal Data?
          <p className="my-2 font-normal">
            At MDLZ, we do not believe in marketing directly to children under
            13 years of age. Therefore, our Sites are not intended for children
            under 13 years old.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2 font-normal">
            We also take the protection of children’s privacy seriously.
            Individuals who are under age as per the appropriate applicable law
            for each Site for the purpose of providing consent, should have a
            parent/guardian’s consent before providing any Personal Data to us
            via the website. If we determine upon collection that a user is
            under age and has not provided a parent/guardian’s consent before
            providing any Personal Data, we will not use or maintain his/her
            Personal Data without the parent/guardian’s consent. Without such
            consent, though, the child/individual may not be able to participate
            in certain activities. However, in certain circumstances, we may
            maintain and use such information (in accordance with the rest of
            this Privacy Notice and applicable law) in order to notify and
            obtain consent from the parent/guardian and for certain safety,
            security, liability, record keeping and other purposes permitted
            under applicable law. A parent/ guardian can review, remove, change
            or refuse further collection or use of their child’s Personal Data
